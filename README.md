Anime Watch List (Title TBD):

Anime Watch List is an for all the otakus out there looking to manage their current watch list.
This app will help you keep count of all the series you are following and is in sync with a online anime database.
It will also allow you to set reminders for a show incase you forget to watch it on TV.

This (unofficially) uses the MAL database.



Developer's Comments:
This app is officialy my second attempt at a complete app although to be honest this has been a much greater effort than the previous one.
